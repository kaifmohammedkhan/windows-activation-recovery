Step 1: Diagnose Activation Failure
- Error code: 0xC004F213 ("No product key found")
- Services failed: sppsvc, SoftwareLicensingService
- Registry corruption detected in HKLM\SYSTEM\WPA
- Activation CLI failed to validate license

Step 2: Fix WPA Registry via Gravesoft Method
- Downloaded rearm.cmd from Gravesoft:
  https://github.com/asdcorp/rearm/archive/refs/heads/principalis.zip
- Saved to: C:\rearm.cmd
- Rebooted into Windows Recovery using:
  shutdown /f /r /o /t 0
- Opened Command Prompt via Troubleshoot > Advanced Options
- Ran:
  C:\rearm.cmd
  (Used bcdedit | find "osdevice" to confirm drive letter if needed)
- Result: Kernel-protected WPA key reset successfully

Step 3: Reboot & Validate Services
- Rebooted system
- Verified sppsvc and SoftwareLicensingService were running
- Registry entries restored under SoftwareProtectionPlatform

Step 4: Launch Activation CLI via PowerShell
- Opened PowerShell as Administrator
- Ran:
  irm https://get.activated.win | iex
- Selected option [1] for Windows activation
- Initial result: Activation failed (0xC004F213)

Step 5: Retry Activation After Registry Fix
- Re-ran CLI activation
- Result: Activation successful

Step 6: Confirm Activation Status
- Ran:
  slmgr /xpr → Output: "Windows is permanently activated"
  slmgr /dlv → Output: License details confirmed
- Status: Windows 10 Pro activated with digital license linked to Microsoft account

Notes:
- No third-party activation tools used
- Recovery performed entirely via native tools, PowerShell, and Gravesoft method
- No data loss or OS reinstall required
